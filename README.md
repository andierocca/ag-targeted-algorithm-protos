# AfterglowATL Targeted Content Algorithm Testbed

## What is this?

In short, ***AfterglowATL*** is an upcoming website for the Atlanta rave/electronic music scene aiming to serve as a unifying hub and local music discovery network.

This code is just a sandbox for me to use object-oriented Java code to develop, refine, and test some of the algorithms I'm going to use to connect users with content, events, DJs, and mixes they will most likely be interested in based on their genre preferences.

Making diagrams on paper and then using Java to quickly model and experiment with data structures and relationships is a lot easier and more fun for me than to jump into SQL and PHP, but fairly soon I'll move my designs in that direction.

I'm putting this on GitHub both to share some of what I learn or create with the rest of the world, and to invite any guidance, insights, or contributions that may come from the community. I'm constantly learning and improving my development skillset, especially in the realm of SQL/database design, and would greatly appreciate any comments or pull requests.

## What can I do with it?

Right now, not much of interest. It creates some test objects, fills them with sample data, and runs test algorithms that print their results to the console.

As this develops, I'm going to add some documentation and data relationship diagrams (minus what could present a future security risk) to better explain how things work and interrelate. Feel free to play with it all you want and use it for any purpose free of restriction! However, I wouldn't try basing any important code on this because it's going to be morphed and reworked quite a bit.

## Usage

This is just garden-variety Java that any remotely recent JDK installation will be able to compile and run. If I use any newer features of Java 7 or 8, I'll note it in this readme file. No build system has been used.

From the terminal, inside the src directory:

	$ javac *.java

	$ java AGContentTargetingPrototype

For now, everything is heavily commented and I have provided no additional documentation.
